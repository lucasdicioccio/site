		<h1>Preserving the treasure of rarely-used words</h1>

	 	<div id="sidebar">
		</div>

		<div id="main">
		<p>Rarely-used words are a treasure; we should use them rarely.
		Human languages are rich and there are many possible sentences
		someone can use to express a concept. Try to make a good use
		when drawing from this treasure because each time you use a
		word you take away a bit of the word's's singularity.
		</p>

		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		
		<p> Our ancestors devised a number of tools to help us
		arbitrage which construction is best for expressing a
		particular concept. One such tool is information theory, which
		is at the root of most, if not all, recent communication
		breakthroughts. <br/> This is not an essay on communication
		theory and I'll just use some fascinating findings to hand-wave
		a number of properties of human languages: on one hand,
		frequent words are generally short  to save resources when
		transmitting sentences (i.e., they necessesitate fewer
		characters, fewer paint strokes than their less-frequent
		counterparts).  On the other hand, prevalent words carry fewer
		information (i.e., you can remove a `the` and still understand
		this sentence, but the sentence becomes misleading if you
		remove `prevalent`). The only thing preventing us from writing
		un-necessary verbiage is the amount of energy and time one is
		willing to spend writing and speaking, or listening and reading
		a piece of document. We do not have infinite time/energy.
		Hence, what matters at the end of the road is how precisely one
		can express a concept within an acceptable given
		<em>word-budget</em>. A word budget can be well-spent, in which
		case redundancies are rare. But a word budget can also be
		misspent -- because communicating is difficult.  </p>
		
		<p> Speaking, writing is diffcult. Most often, short sentences
		are better than long sentences, simple words are better than
		elevated language, and direct style is more engaging than
		convoluted constructions.  Unfortunately it <b>requires
			effort</b> to come up with short, simple, and direct
		sentences. In particular, face-to-face and phone-based
		discussions happen <em>synchronously</em>. That is, your
		audience is busy waiting for your opinion. It is quite impolite
		or uncomforting (in some culture) to make your audience wait
		for an extended duration. Regrettably, we humans are
		poorly-trained to build flawless sentences on-the-fly. We also
		are quite tolerant of clunky sentences, because we want to be
		nice. As a result, we do not help each other much and reinforce
		the status quo. More concerning, once a rarely-used word is
		being introduced at an increasing frequency, there is a risk
		that we adopt an imprecise or a misleading meaning for the
		word.<p>

		<p>This page is my attempt to preserve the rarity of some
		infrequent words: technical <em>jargon</em> in computer
		engineering. In this field, we ought to describe computer
		programs, system behaviors, or interfaces accurately. At the
		same time we need to bend the meaning of human words to fit the
		mechanical processes of computer codes.  Most often, it's just
		our human languages evolving and we should not fight
		excessively, but sometimes people will misemploy a word or
		stretch a concept to gain some advantage, to sell more
		products, or attracting more mindshare. Such situations are
		unfortunate and this page will articulate my interpretation of
		when to best use some technical terms.
