		<h2> Rarely-used words are a treasure </h2>
		<p>Rarely-used words are a treasure; we should use them rarely.
		Human languages are rich and there are many possible sentences
		someone can use to express a concept. Try to make a good use
		when drawing from this treasure because each time you use a
		word you take away a bit of the word singularity. Our
		ancestors devised a number of tools to help us arbitrage which
		construction is best for expressing a particular concept. One
		such tool is information theory, which is at the root of most,
		if not all, recent communication breakthroughts. <br/>
		This is not an essay on communication theory and I'll jump
		straight to findings. Leveraging theoretical results from
		information theory, one can hand-wave a number of properties of
		human languages: on one hand, frequent words are generally
		short  to save resources when transmitting sentences (i.e.,
		they necessesitate fewer characters, fewer paint strokes than
		their less-frequent counterparts).  On the other hand,
		prevalent words carry fewer information (i.e., you can remove a
		`the` and still understand this sentence, but the sentence
		becomes misleading if you remove `prevalent`). The only thing
		preventing us from writing un-necessary verbiage is the amount
		of energy and time one is willing to spend writing and
		speaking, or listening and reading a piece of document. We do
		not have infinite time/energy.  Hence, what matters at the end
		of the road is how precisely one can express a concept within
		an acceptable given <em>word-budget</em>. A word budget can be
		well-spent, in which case redundancies are rare and a few words
		carry enough information. But a word budget can also be
		misspent -- because communicating is difficult.<br>
		</p>
		
		<h2> Communicating is difficult </h2> <p> Speaking, writing is
		diffcult. Most often, short sentences are better than long
		sentences; simple words are better than elevated language,
		direct style is more engaging than convoluted constructions.
		Unfortunately, a vast amount of human communication are
		synchronous. That is, your audience is busy waiting for your
		opinion. It is quite impolite or uncomfortable (in some
		culture) to make your audience wait for extended duration.
		Unfortunately, despite communicating being one of human's
		favourite occupation, our human brains are poorly-trained to
		build flawless sentences on-the-fly. As a result, when
		listening we are rather tolerant of poor sentences and do not
		help each other.  </p>
		
		<h2> More jargon </h2> <p>Some words are
		frequent in a particular genre of articles (e.g., documents
		about programming written in English) while infrequent across
		all genres of articles (e.g., all documents written in
		English). Words with such properties are keywords for a topic.
		Figuratively, keywords are landmarks in the landscape of
		documents. Let's call these keywords <em>jargon</em>. I care
		significantly about well-defined jargon. As a writer and reader
		of technical English (English ain't my native language) I
		prefer mathematically-sound definitions of jargon but I
		recognize that vagueness is important. 

		This leads me to the second point: often use rare words, but in
		fine proportions.
